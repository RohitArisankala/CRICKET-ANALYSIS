                   <h1 class="head2"> DEPARTMENT PROFILE</h1>
<p>Computing has been in the centre stage of human life since last over two decades. Almost all walks of human life have been influenced by computing. Capturing various kinds of data, processing them, and helping humans to take intelligent decisions are some of the objectives of computing. Additionally, development of software tools not limited to operating systems, compilers, databases, debuggers, mobile apps, etc. are also vital part of the computing arena.

New areas of computing are evolving fast such as High-Performance Computing, Robotics, IoT, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, etc. in addition to the Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cyber Security, Data Science, etc. The dept. encourages students to take up major projects in these areas.

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in the year 1998, since inception of the Institute. It was started with B.Tech. (CSE) programme with an intake of 60 and it has grown by leaps and bounds over the last two decades with an intake increased to 180 by the year 2020. Since the Academic Year 2020-2021, B. Tech programmes for two new specializations in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI & ML) and Cyber Security (CS) were introduced with an intake of 60 each. M. Tech. programme also started in the year 2005 with an intake of 18. The Dept. of CSE is one of the largest depts. of the Institution and maintains a high reputation for being a highly vibrant dept. of the campus.

The dept. is known for imbibing human values and feel of nationalism in addition the regular teaching-learning activities. Large number students undertake courses beyond syllabus and obtain certification.

The Department has 4 modern laboratories with the names Arya Bhatta Computing Lab, Advanced Computing Lab, Language Processing & Simulation Lab and Computational Intelligence Lab to serve the learning needs of the students.

Department of CSE maintains a library with a large collection of books to substantiate the requirements of students. There are other collections as well such as UG and PG project reports, copy of research publications, magazines, journals, course files, etc. in the dept. library

A Research Centre for the Department has been approved by JNTUK, Kakinada in AY 2018-2019 to involve the faculty members in research activities

Department has a MoU with Virtusa Corporation and established the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in 2017. Since then, training of students on current cutting-edge technologies as well as placements are part of the MoU

Students are exposed to co-curricular and extra-curricular activities at the Institute level, inter institutional level and university level. Majority of eligible students of the department will be either captivated by MNC's for placement or may opt for higher education in India or abroad

The Dept. of CSE provides the best platform for a budding computer engineer to catch the highest in life
